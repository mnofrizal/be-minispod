   - **[`src/routes/admin/workers.routes.js`](src/routes/admin/workers.routes.js)**: Admin worker management
   - **[`src/routes/admin/billing.routes.js`](src/routes/admin/billing.routes.js)**: Admin billing management

3. **Removed User-Facing Pod Endpoints**: Pod management is now admin-only; users access pods through subscription endpoints

### Pod Management Architecture Improvements

**Controller Pattern Standardization**: Refactored pod controller to follow proper architecture patterns like auth controller.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Controller Refactoring**:

   - **[`src/controllers/pod.controller.js`](src/controllers/pod.controller.js)**: Converted from object methods to individual exported functions
   - **Individual Function Exports**: `getAllPods`, `getPodById`, `restartPod`, `stopPod`, `startPod`, `deletePod`, `getOrphanedPods`, `cleanupOrphanedPods`, `debugKubernetesState`
   - **Proper Service Layer Calls**: Each controller function calls corresponding service functions

2. **Service Layer Enhancement**:

   - **[`src/services/pod.service.js`](src/services/pod.service.js)**: Enhanced with individual function exports
   - **Stop/Start Functionality**: Added `stopPod` and `startPod` functions using Kubernetes deployment scaling
   - **Enhanced Restart**: `restartPod` now handles stopped pods (0 replicas) properly
   - **Local Access Information**: Added development environment port forwarding commands

3. **Database Schema Updates**:
   - **New Pod Statuses**: Added `RESTARTING` and `STOPPED` to PodStatus enum
   - **Prisma Migration**: Applied database migration for new statuses

### Container Port Configuration Fix

**Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved container port configuration issues that were breaking pod deployment.

**Issues Resolved**:

1. **Missing Container Port in getAllPods**: Fixed missing `containerPort` field selection causing incorrect local access information
2. **Broken Pod Deployment**: Fixed `createDeployment` function parameter passing for container ports
3. **Consistent Port Usage**: Ensured all pod management functions use correct container ports from service catalog

**Technical Details**:

- **N8N**: Port 5678 (correctly configured)
- **Ghost**: Port 2368 (correctly configured)
- **WordPress**: Port 80 (correctly configured)
- **Local Access**: Development environment shows correct `kubectl port-forward` commands

### Redis Configuration Fix

**Issue Resolved**: The [`queue.manager.js`](src/jobs/queue.manager.js) was looking for `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, and `REDIS_DB` environment variables, but the `.env` file contained unused `BULL_REDIS_*` variables instead.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Removed unused variables** from `.env`:

   - `REDIS_URL="redis://100.90.149.26:6379"` (not used by any code)
   - `BULL_REDIS_HOST`, `BULL_REDIS_PORT`, `BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD`, `BULL_REDIS_DB` (not used by any code)

2. **Added correct Redis variables** to `.env`:
   ```bash
   # Redis Configuration for Bull Queues
   REDIS_HOST="100.90.149.26"
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=""
   REDIS_DB=0
   ```

**Result**: The Bull queue system now successfully connects to Redis using the correct environment variables. The configuration is clean, consistent, and free of unused variables.

   - **[`rest/admin-subscriptions.rest`](rest/admin-subscriptions.rest)**: Complete REST API testing for admin subscription endpoints

2. **Security Vulnerability Fixes**:

   - **[`src/validations/subscription.validation.js`](src/validations/subscription.validation.js)**: **SECURITY FIX** - Removed status field from user update schema to prevent privilege escalation
   - **[`src/controllers/subscription.controller.js`](src/controllers/subscription.controller.js)**: **SECURITY FIX** - Removed status update logic from user controller
   - **[`src/routes/subscriptions.routes.js`](src/routes/subscriptions.routes.js)**: **CLEANED UP** - Removed duplicate admin routes that were already properly implemented in admin routes file

3. **Database Architecture Improvements**:

   - **[`prisma/schema.prisma`](prisma/schema.prisma)**: Added direct transaction relation to Subscription model and removed redundant SubscriptionTransaction model
   - **[`src/services/billing.service.js`](src/services/billing.service.js)**: Updated to populate both referenceId and subscriptionId for proper Prisma relations
   - **[`scripts/migrate-subscription-transactions.js`](scripts/migrate-subscription-transactions.js)**: Database migration script to populate missing subscriptionId values in existing transactions

### Database Schema Evolution

**Major Architectural Improvement**: Unified transaction model with proper Prisma relations and removed redundant models.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Enhanced Subscription Model**:

   ```prisma
   model Subscription {
     // ... existing fields
     transactions Transaction[] @relation("SubscriptionTransactions")
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Transaction Model**:

   ```prisma
   model Transaction {
     // ... existing fields
     subscriptionId String?
     subscription Subscription? @relation("SubscriptionTransactions", fields: [subscriptionId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
   }
   ```

3. **Removed Redundant Models**:
   - **SubscriptionTransaction model**: Removed as redundant with unified Transaction model
   - **SubscriptionTransactionType enum**: Removed as no longer needed
   - **SubscriptionTransactionStatus enum**: Removed as no longer needed

### Subscription Lifecycle Improvements

**Enhanced Subscription Flow**: Implemented proper PENDING_DEPLOYMENT → ACTIVE transition and fixed pod status detection.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Proper Subscription Lifecycle**:

   - **[`src/services/subscription.service.js`](src/services/subscription.service.js)**: Fixed subscription creation to start with PENDING_DEPLOYMENT status
   - **[`src/services/pod.service.js`](src/services/pod.service.js)**: **FIXED** - Pod status detection logic to show proper PENDING → RUNNING flow instead of FAILED → RUNNING
   - **Subscription Status Updates**: Added subscription status update function in pod service when pod becomes ready

2. **Automatic Pod Management**:

   - **Status-Based Pod Control**: Subscription status changes automatically trigger corresponding pod actions
   - **ACTIVE Status**: Automatically restarts pods to ensure service availability
   - **CANCELLED/EXPIRED/SUSPENDED Status**: Automatically stops pods to conserve resources

### Security Improvements

**Critical Security Fixes**: Prevented subscription status manipulation and implemented proper access controls.

**Security Issues Fixed**:

1. **Subscription Status Manipulation (CRITICAL)**:

   - **Issue**: Users could bypass billing by manually setting subscription status to "ACTIVE"
   - **Fix**: Removed `status` field from user validation schema and controller logic
   - **Impact**: Users can no longer manipulate subscription status - only system/admin can change it

2. **Pod Lifecycle Bypass (HIGH)**:

   - **Issue**: Users could break the PENDING_DEPLOYMENT → ACTIVE flow
   - **Fix**: Status updates now only handled by system when pod becomes ready
   - **Impact**: Proper subscription lifecycle integrity maintained

3. **Route Architecture Cleanup (MEDIUM)**:
   - **Issue**: Admin routes were duplicated in user subscription routes file
   - **Fix**: Removed duplicate admin routes from user subscription routes file
   - **Benefit**: Clean separation between user and admin endpoints
