## Recent Updates (2025-07-24)

### Redis Configuration Fix

**Issue Resolved**: The [`queue.manager.js`](src/jobs/queue.manager.js) was looking for `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, and `REDIS_DB` environment variables, but the `.env` file contained unused `BULL_REDIS_*` variables instead.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Removed unused variables** from `.env`:

   - `REDIS_URL="redis://100.90.149.26:6379"` (not used by any code)
   - `BULL_REDIS_HOST`, `BULL_REDIS_PORT`, `BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD`, `BULL_REDIS_DB` (not used by any code)

2. **Added correct Redis variables** to `.env`:

   ```bash
   # Redis Configuration for Bull Queues
   REDIS_HOST="100.90.149.26"
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=""
   REDIS_DB=0
   ```

3. **Updated Memory Bank**: Updated `tech.md` and `context.md` to reflect the current Redis configuration and document the Bull queue system properly.

**Result**: The Bull queue system now successfully connects to Redis using the correct environment variables. The configuration is clean, consistent, and free of unused variables.
