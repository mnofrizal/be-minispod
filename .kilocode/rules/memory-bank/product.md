# Product Definition - PaaS Backend

## What This Product Is

A **Backend API system** for a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that enables customers to instantly deploy and manage containerized services (N8N, Ghost, WordPress, etc.) through monthly subscriptions.

## Problems It Solves

### For Customers

- **Complex Setup Elimination**: No need to manually configure servers, databases, or deployments
- **Instant Service Access**: Get production-ready N8N, Ghost, or WordPress instances in 2-5 minutes
- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: No server maintenance, updates, or scaling concerns
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-per-use model without upfront infrastructure costs

### For Business

- **Scalable Revenue Model**: Monthly recurring subscriptions with automated lifecycle management
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient utilization of 3-node K3s cluster (~76-82 customer pods)
- **Automated Operations**: Minimal manual intervention for customer onboarding and management

## How It Should Work

### Customer Experience Flow

1. **Browse & Select**: Customer views service catalog (N8N, Ghost, WordPress)
2. **Instant Checkout**: Free trial signup with dummy payment (Rp 0)
3. **Auto-Provisioning**: Backend automatically deploys pod with unique subdomain
4. **Immediate Access**: Customer receives credentials and access URL within minutes
5. **Self-Service Management**: Dashboard to monitor pod status, usage, and subscription
6. **Lifecycle Management**: Automatic renewal, expiry handling, and cleanup

### Service Delivery Model
