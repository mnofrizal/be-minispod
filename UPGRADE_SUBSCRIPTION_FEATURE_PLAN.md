# Upgrade Subscription Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding subscription upgrade/downgrade functionality to the PaaS backend system. Currently, users cannot upgrade their subscription plans without losing data and paying double charges.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Functionality

- ✅ Create new subscriptions
- ✅ View subscription details
- ✅ Renew subscriptions
- ✅ Cancel subscriptions
- ✅ Basic billing with balance management

### Missing Functionality

- ❌ Upgrade to higher plans
- ❌ Downgrade to lower plans
- ❌ Prorated billing calculations
- ❌ Seamless pod resource migration
- ❌ Plan change history tracking

## Business Requirements

### User Stories

**As a customer, I want to:**

1. Upgrade my N8N Basic plan to N8N Plus without losing my workflows
2. Only pay the prorated difference when upgrading mid-cycle
3. Experience zero downtime during plan changes
4. See available upgrade options with clear pricing
5. Downgrade my plan if needed with appropriate refunds

**As an admin, I want to:**

1. Track all plan changes and their financial impact
2. Monitor upgrade/downgrade patterns for business insights
3. Handle edge cases and failed upgrades
4. Provide customer support for plan changes

### Business Rules

1. **Prorated Billing**: Users pay only the difference for remaining days in the billing cycle
2. **Data Preservation**: All user data must be preserved during plan changes
3. **Zero Downtime**: Pod resource changes should not cause service interruption
4. **Balance Validation**: Users must have sufficient balance for upgrades
5. **Refund Policy**: Downgrades provide prorated refunds to user balance

## Technical Architecture

### 1. API Endpoints Design

#### New Subscription Routes

```
GET    /api/v1/subscriptions/:id/upgrade-options
POST   /api/v1/subscriptions/:id/upgrade
POST   /api/v1/subscriptions/:id/downgrade
POST   /api/v1/subscriptions/:id/change-plan
GET    /api/v1/subscriptions/:id/change-history
```

#### Admin Routes

```
GET    /api/v1/admin/subscriptions/upgrade-analytics
POST   /api/v1/admin/subscriptions/:id/force-upgrade
GET    /api/v1/admin/subscriptions/failed-upgrades
```

### 2. Database Schema Changes

#### New Tables

```sql
-- Plan change history tracking
CREATE TABLE subscription_plan_changes (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  subscription_id VARCHAR REFERENCES subscriptions(id),
  from_service_id VARCHAR REFERENCES service_catalog(id),
  to_service_id VARCHAR REFERENCES service_catalog(id),
  change_type ENUM('UPGRADE', 'DOWNGRADE'),
  prorated_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  status ENUM('PENDING', 'COMPLETED', 'FAILED', 'ROLLED_BACK'),
  initiated_by VARCHAR REFERENCES users(id),
  initiated_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  failure_reason TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Prorated billing calculations
CREATE TABLE prorated_calculations (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  subscription_id VARCHAR REFERENCES subscriptions(id),
  old_plan_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  new_plan_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  remaining_days INTEGER,
  total_days INTEGER,
  refund_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  charge_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  net_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  calculation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Schema Modifications

```sql
-- Add upgrade tracking to subscriptions table
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN last_plan_change_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN plan_change_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Add upgrade metadata to service instances
ALTER TABLE service_instances ADD COLUMN resource_migration_history JSONB;
ALTER TABLE service_instances ADD COLUMN last_resource_update TIMESTAMP;
```

### 3. Service Layer Architecture

#### Billing Service Enhancements

- `calculateProratedUpgrade(subscriptionId, newServiceId)`
- `processUpgradePayment(subscriptionId, proratedAmount)`
- `processDowngradeRefund(subscriptionId, refundAmount)`
- `validateUpgradeEligibility(subscriptionId, newServiceId)`

#### Subscription Service Enhancements

- `getUpgradeOptions(subscriptionId)`
- `upgradeSubscription(subscriptionId, newServiceId, options)`
- `downgradeSubscription(subscriptionId, newServiceId, options)`
- `rollbackPlanChange(planChangeId)`

#### Pod Service Enhancements

- `migratePodResources(serviceInstanceId, newResourceConfig)`
- `validateResourceMigration(currentResources, newResources)`
- `rollbackResourceMigration(serviceInstanceId, backupConfig)`

### 4. Kubernetes Integration

#### Resource Migration Strategy

1. **Rolling Update Approach**: Update deployment resources without pod recreation
2. **Validation**: Ensure new resources are compatible with current workload
3. **Rollback**: Ability to revert resource changes if issues occur
4. **Monitoring**: Track resource utilization during and after migration

#### Pod Management Enhancements

- Resource limit updates via Kubernetes API
- Health check validation post-migration
- Automatic rollback on migration failure
- Resource usage monitoring and alerting

## Technical Specifications

### Prorated Billing Algorithm

```
Prorated Calculation Logic:
1. Calculate remaining days in current billing cycle
2. Calculate unused amount from current plan
3. Calculate prorated amount for new plan
4. Net amount = new_plan_prorated - unused_current_plan

Example:
- Current: N8N Basic (IDR 50,000/month)
- New: N8N Plus (IDR 100,000/month)
- Remaining days: 15 out of 30
- Unused current: 50,000 * (15/30) = 25,000
- New plan prorated: 100,000 * (15/30) = 50,000
- Net charge: 50,000 - 25,000 = 25,000
```

### Resource Migration Strategy

```
Pod Resource Migration Process:
1. Validate new resource requirements
2. Check cluster capacity for new resources
3. Update deployment with new resource limits
4. Monitor pod health during transition
5. Verify successful migration
6. Update database records
7. Send notification to user
```

### Error Handling and Rollback

```
Upgrade Failure Scenarios:
1. Insufficient user balance → Reject upgrade
2. Kubernetes resource update failure → Rollback transaction
3. Pod health check failure → Rollback resources
4. Database update failure → Rollback all changes
5. Payment processing failure → Rollback subscription changes
```
